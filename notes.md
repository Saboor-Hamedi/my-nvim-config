# Best Vim practice

VIM is one the fastest terminal based IDE, there could be different ideas for defining vim, but 
I would call it "terminal based IDE" vim enabled you to code faster and and have more control over 
your IDE. There are alot of IDE that you work with, such as Sublime, Vscode,and Notepad++ 

Vim is hard and easy, one cannot learn vim over night, it needs alot of practice, memorization of 
the keys.
`Note:` I am also learning vim,this note by no means would be perfect,but I am sure if you follow this note, you will learn alot. 

    1. This is a practice note
    2. Through this note I will learn alot 
    3. try to read this note as mush as possible 
    4. I will try my best to keep this note clean plus readable

## How to use vim?
    * You must be patient 
    * You must pratice alot
    * You must know how remember the keysmaps (shortcuts)

 Delete insid the double qoute 
 "Delete me with " -> ci"  lets say there insid the double qoute there are text
 just press ci and ", it will basically delete the text. 
 "Hello world" same thing goes for others like (){}[]
 'Hello world'
. **GG** move the cursor to the last line, it works with G as well,
. **gg** move the cursor to the top of the line at the very top of the page. 
. **dw** delete a single word, this will basically delete from the cursor till the end
. **d$** delete from the cursor position
. **zt** move the screen cursor to the top
. **ci** delete the work from inside the double qoute, single qoute, **{}** and other symbols
. **cc** will delete the whole line, unline **dw** which deletes a single word
. **e** move one word 
. **ve** select from the cursor position to the end the word


## Move quickly
The purpose of vim is to navigate quickly over you app and notes, or any other things. For that
there are plugins, but I would rather choose the core vim which enables me to move faster inside
the buffer. 
On `NORMAL` mode press `s` and you will the text inside you buffer disables, click any other lettersthat you want to jump on, and see the next letter is highlighted press it and it will take to that
word.
